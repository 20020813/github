# Issues for Github

**This is not the repository for the github website.**

Issues and feature requests posted to github are not stored in any
publicly available location, so I find that I quickly lose track of
the things that I've sent them.

If you are a githubber, and you would like to respond and close issues
on this repository, please let me (or one of the other collaborators)
know, and we'll add you as a collaborator.  Or maybe use some secret
github internal APIs to get access, if you have such things.  If you
want to know what people are asking for, or ask for them to provide
details about use cases etc, then head over to the issues list.

Post an issue if you have an issue or feature request for Github.  **But
you should also email support@github.com, since this repo is strictly
for our own (unofficial) tracking purposes.**
